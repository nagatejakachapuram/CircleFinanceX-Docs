# Real Estate Module – Overview

The **Real Estate Module** of Circle Pay allows users to invest in **tokenized real estate properties** using **USDC**.  
This brings traditional real estate into Web3, enabling **fractional ownership**, **automated rent distribution**, and **maintenance fee management** — all on-chain.

## Key Features

- **Fractional Ownership**: Buy property shares as on-chain tokens.
- **USDC-based Transactions**: All purchases, rent distributions, and fees are handled in USDC.
- **Automated Rent Payouts**: Receive periodic rental income directly to your wallet.
- **Maintenance Cost Handling**: Pay upkeep fees or have them auto-deducted from rental income.
- **Full Transparency**: All transactions are verifiable on-chain.

## How It Works

1. **Properties are Tokenized**

   - Each property is represented as a tokenized asset (**ERC-20** for fractional shares or **ERC-721/1155** for unique ownership).
   - Ownership is tracked on-chain.

2. **Buy Shares with USDC**

   - Investors purchase shares by transferring **USDC** to the property’s smart contract.

3. **Earn Rental Income**

   - Rent collected off-chain is converted to USDC and **distributed proportionally** to token holders.

4. **Maintenance Fee Deduction**
   - Maintenance fees are **paid by investors** or **deducted from rental income** automatically.
